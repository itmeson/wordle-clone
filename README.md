# wordle-clone

This is a version of the game Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) by Josh Wardle that I am making as a teaching tool for a high school software development class. It is only intended for classroom use.

The main functional difference between this and the original is that this version generates a new random word on each reload, rather than once per day, and this version does not produce statistics or shareable results.  It is also possible to cheat on this version using the browser console (don't do that!)
